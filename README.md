# Master-Thesis: Absorbed dose maps of patients submitted to 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT

The main aim of this dissertation was to evaluate the whole-body absorbed doses of a group of patients at the Champalimaud Foundation's Nuclear Medicine Department, based on 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT images. To this end, a statistical analysis was made of the doses absorbed by the patients from images acquired by a digital PET/CT scanner - VEREOS-. These values were then compared with data in the literature to analyze the safety of using 68Ga-PSMA-11 in nuclear medicine clinics.
